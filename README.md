# 2028

This project is an old personal project from 2017 when I was first learning programming, more specifically Python. The goal is to recreate the game 2048 on Terminal.

## How to run

Run ./Jeux.py

## How to play

Warning: This project was designed with an AZERTY keyboard in mind.
The game will first ask for the board size (the minimal size is 4). To chose a direction, enter either Q(left), S(down), D(right) or Z(Up). To quit, enter 0. The game will end automatically when no movement is possible. When the game ends, you can see the previous highscores and register your own.
